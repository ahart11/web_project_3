/*Note to Code Reviewer: Thank you so much for your newest comments, I have made all of the requested 
changes and I hope my project is able to pass.

In the previous code review comments, my footer layout looked incorrect. I worked extensively with Maksim 
to make it look correct. This involved changing some of the values in the code from what the values in the 
brief, to different values. Based on your newest comments I have changed those values back again to
what they were in the brief (for example, flex-basis: 711px; for .footer__column_content_copyright.)

Now my footer layout looks like it did before, but I have checked over and over, and all of the values
are correct according to the brief. If you need to reject my project again because of footer layout, please let 
me where where my mistake is in the code because it all should be correct now. 

Maksim also said that the screenshots in the brief are inaccurate, and I shouldn't use them with
PixelPerfect to match my layout and make it accurate. Maksim gave me different screenshots to use.

I used them and my layout looked exactly accurate the last time I submitted the project. I showed
Maksim and he said it is perfect now. But my project was rejected so evidently it was still wrong.

I have tried over and over but when I use correct values from the brief, the layout doesn't
look exactly like Maksim's screenshot. And when I match my layout to Maksim's screenshot I cannot
use the exact values from the brief.

So I hope that my project can pass anyway even if the layout doesn't look exact, again, 
because I am using all the correct values. I apologize because it keeps wasting your time to
resubmit this project multiple times over this very small issue, I hope I have it right this time.

I hope you don't mind my note, I have no other way to communicate with code reviewers and I wanted
to explain the situation*/
